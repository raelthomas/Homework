Assignment descriptions and student submissions for homework involving coding

## Downloading Assignment Materials
When the assignment is released, you can `pull` the needed materials (HW description and any materials, such as code templates), using git:

1. Fork this repository: In the upper right corner of this page, there is a button labeled 'fork.' Clicking this will create a copy of this 'Homework' repository in your personal GitHub page.

2. Clone your repository: on your machine (either using a terminal/command line or the Git Desktop GUI), clone your repository:

``` git clone <repo address> ```
  
  where <repo address> is the address to the forked repository (click the green 'Code' button on the repo's home page).
  
This downloads a copy of this repository, but also creates a link to your github page.  In git parlance, this link establishes your page as a 'remote' that your code connects to.  Because you cloned from this particular remote, it considers your page the 'origin.'
 
3. Add this repository as a remote (I name it `class`, below, but call it whatever you like):

``` git remote add class https://github.com/Echem-Systems-Engineering-Fall2020/Homework.git```
